\title{IRTpp : Item Response Theory Implemented in R and Cpp}
\description{
IRTpp supports the IRT and MIRT methodologies by implementing
many IRT relevant algorithms for model exploration, calibration and fitting, IRTpp
aims to be extremely performant using Cpp where it is needed, focusing in extending
IRT not only to classical applications but also in new applications which sometimes
need highly performant implementations.
