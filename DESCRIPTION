Title: Estimating IRT parameters using the IRT Methodology
Version: 0.1.21
Date: 2015-02-03
Author: Developed by SICS Research Group
Maintainer: Juan Liberato <jcliberatol@unal.edu.co>
Description: An implementation of the IRT paradigm for the scoring of diferent 
  instruments measuring latent traits (a.k.a Abilities) and estimating item parameters
  for a variety of models, this package is highly optimized using Cpp and carefully written
  R for the rest of the package, it aims to expand IRT applications to those aplications that
  require faster and more robust estimation procedures. See the IRTpp documentation and github site
  for more information and examples.
