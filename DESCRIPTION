Title: Estimating IRT parameters using the IRT Methodology
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2015-11-27
Author: Developed by SICS Research Group
Maintainer: Juan Liberato <jcliberatol@unal.edu.co>
Description: IRTpp supports the IRT and MIRT methodologies by implementing 
    many IRT relevant algorithms for model exploration, calibration and 
    fitting, IRTpp aims to be a high IRT performance software, using C++ where it is
    needed.  IRTpp can be used not only on classical IRT applications but 
    also on data mining. Particularly in textual analysis.
