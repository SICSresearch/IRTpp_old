#' @title IRTpp : Item Response Theory Implemented in R and Cpp
#' @description IRTpp supports the IRT and MIRT methodologies by implementing 
#' many IRT relevant algorithms for model exploration, calibration and 
#' fitting, IRTpp aims to be a high IRT performance software, using C++ where it is
#' needed.  IRTpp can be used not only on classical IRT applications but 
#' also on data mining. Particularly in textual analysis.
