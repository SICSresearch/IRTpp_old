#' @title IRTpp : Item Response Theory Implemented in R and Cpp
#' @description IRTpp supports the IRT and MIRT methodologies by implementing 
#' many IRT relevant algorithms for model exploration, calibration and fitting, IRTpp
#' aims to be extremely performant using Cpp where it is needed, focusing in extending
#' IRT not only to classical applications but also in new applications which sometimes 
#' need highly performant implementations.
